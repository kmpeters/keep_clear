DESCRIPTION

keep_clear allows the user to specify directories that should be kept clear of data files.  It was written to work around the
problem of increasing delays when writing hundreds of thousands of files to a samba server.

SPECIFICS

keep_clear

This is the script that is run by the user.  It maintains a list of the directories that should be kept clear.

keep_clear_cron

This is the script that is called by cron, every two minutes.  If there are directories to keep clear, it calls keep_clear_script.

keep_clear_script

This is the script that does the work.  It moves and optionally copies the data files.

INSTALLATION

keep_clear must be installed in a directory that is on the path.  The other two scripts can reside anywhere, however
keep_clear_cron contains the variable MOVE_SCRIPT which needs to accurately reflect the location of keep_clear_script.

Here is an example installation:

~/bin/keep_clear (add ~/bin to PATH)

~/.keep_clear/keep_clear_cron
~/.keep_clear/keep_clear_script

And the following should be added to cron:

0-59/2 * * * * $HOME/.keep_clear/keep_clear_cron >> /dev/null 2>&1

HOW TO ACTUALLY USE IT

Usage: keep_clear [OPTIONS]
Adds (or removes) jobs to (or from) the list of directories to keep clear of data files.
If no option is specified, a job will be added for the current working directory.

  -h,             displays this help
  -l,             list the directories that will be cleared
  -a <path>,      add a directory other than the current working directory
  -r <path>,      removes the job for the given data directory
  -c <path>,      copies data files to another directory before moving them
  -e <extension>, data file extension, without the dot, default: h5
  -t <days>,      time to keep directory clear before expiring, default: 3
  -s <dir name>,  name of data subdirectory, default: images
  -v,             displays the version
